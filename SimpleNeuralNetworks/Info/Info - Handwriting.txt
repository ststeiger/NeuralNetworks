How would I go about creating a neural network that can read my handwriting ? 
Creating a neural network to recognize your handwriting involves several steps. Here is a general overview of the process:

Collect a dataset of handwritten samples: To train a neural network to recognize your handwriting, you will need a dataset of handwritten samples. You can create this dataset by writing out samples of each character or word you want the network to recognize.

Preprocess the dataset: Before training the neural network, you will need to preprocess the dataset to normalize the data and make it easier for the network to learn from. This may involve steps such as resizing the images, applying image filters to enhance contrast or remove noise, and converting the images to grayscale.

Design the neural network architecture: The architecture of the neural network will depend on the specifics of your handwriting recognition task. You may choose to use a convolutional neural network (CNN) or a recurrent neural network (RNN), depending on whether you are recognizing individual characters or full words. You will also need to decide on the number of layers, activation functions, and other parameters for the network.

Train the neural network: Once you have designed the network architecture, you can train the network using your preprocessed dataset. During training, the network will learn to recognize patterns in the handwriting samples and make predictions about the correct output for a given input.

Test the neural network: After training the network, you can test its accuracy by providing it with new handwriting samples and measuring its ability to correctly recognize the characters or words. You may need to tweak the network architecture or training parameters if the accuracy is not satisfactory.

Overall, creating a handwriting recognition neural network can be a complex process, but there are many resources available online to help you get started. You can use machine learning frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch to design and train your network, and there are many tutorials and examples available to guide you through the process.
