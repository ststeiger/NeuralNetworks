How would I go about creating a neural network that can do basic arithmetic given sample texts and results ? 

To create a neural network that can do basic arithmetic given sample texts and results, you can follow these general steps:

Collect a dataset of arithmetic expressions and their corresponding results: To train the neural network, you will need a dataset of arithmetic expressions and their corresponding results. The expressions can be in text format, and the results should be in numerical format.

Preprocess the dataset: Before training the neural network, you will need to preprocess the dataset to normalize the data and make it easier for the network to learn from. This may involve steps such as tokenizing the text expressions, converting them to a numerical representation, and normalizing the numerical values.

Design the neural network architecture: The architecture of the neural network will depend on the specifics of your arithmetic task. You may choose to use a recurrent neural network (RNN) or a transformer-based model, depending on the complexity of the expressions and the desired accuracy. You will also need to decide on the number of layers, activation functions, and other parameters for the network.

Train the neural network: Once you have designed the network architecture, you can train the network using your preprocessed dataset. During training, the network will learn to recognize patterns in the arithmetic expressions and make predictions about the correct output for a given input.

Test the neural network: After training the network, you can test its accuracy by providing it with new arithmetic expressions and measuring its ability to correctly predict the result. You may need to tweak the network architecture or training parameters if the accuracy is not satisfactory.

Overall, creating a neural network for basic arithmetic can be a challenging but rewarding task. There are many resources available online to help you get started, including machine learning frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch, and there are many tutorials and examples available to guide you through the process.
